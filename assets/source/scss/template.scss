/*
 * 1. Settings
 * These contain global settings like colours base font size and config variables.
 * Other settings should live beside the code they belong to keeping everything trim
*/

/*
 * 2. Tools
 * Global Mixins and Functions that need to be access by the whole layout

/*
 * 3. Generic
 * The first layer that produces any css. Very high level css that is seldom changed
*/
@import "generic/generic";

/*
 * 4. Elements
 * These are the bare un classed items Headings etc this is where we define the base styling for these
*/
@import "elements/elements";

/*
 * 5. Objects
 * First layer we start to use class based selectors
 * You will find common classes in here like .wrapper, .row
*/
@import "objects/objects";

/*
 * 6. Components
 * The layer where we style recognisable pieces of UI. We shouldn't find any selectors with a lower specificity than one class
*/
@import "components/components";

/*
 * 7. Trumps
 * This layer beats or trumps all other layers. It has the power to override anything at all. Helper and utility classes.
 * !important rules and clearfixes etc will be found in here along with layout helpers such as grid overlays etc.
